<span class="letterine"><i>S</i>tarlink is coming to India</span>. This means a lot for the Indian telecom industry and well as for the nation as a whole. In this blog post, I aim to explain how starlink works and if it is really needed for our country.

## What is Starlink?
Starlink is a constellation of thousands of satellites in [low earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit#) being setup to provide low-cost, high-performance Internet access anywhere in the world. 

Unveiling the project in 2015 Elon Musk said:
> ["The focus is going to be on creating a global communication system. In the long term, it will be like rebuilding the internet in space. The goal will be to have the majority of long distance internet traffic go over this network and about 10% local and business traffic."](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303083932/http://shitelonsays.com/transcript/spacex-seattle-2015-2015-01-15)

In June 2019 Elon said the value of Starlink is to provide **low-latency, high-bandwidth internet access** to the sparse and moderately sparse and relatively low density areas. Rural and semi-rural places that don't have any adequate internet access are optimal and will target 3% - 5% of people in the world. *It is not well suited for high density cities.*

**Side note:**
Starlink also has a lot of [defense utilities](https://www.wired.com/story/us-navy-starlink-sea2/) such as being able to communicate via internet on navy ships and in remote locations

This would be useful for people living in areas prone to cyclones and floods; not to mention the people who live in remote locations and places where communication towers cannot be built, such as border territory. 


## Internet Landscape in India

As per data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), we can see that **944.96 million users** are subscribed to either wireless or wired broadband connections. From this, we can infer that around **64% of India's population** is connected to the internet.

 This is by no means an easy task considering the [various challenges](https://www.communicationstoday.co.in/telecom-in-india-a-year-of-growth-and-challenges-looking-ahead-to-2025/) that the telecom industry faces. Providing stable and cheap connection to all households, in all regions is a Herculean task. 

Initiatives like [Digital India](https://www.digitalindia.gov.in/) is helping our country to improve our online infrastructure and increase internet accessibility across the country. However, challenges such as [internet shutdowns](https://web.archive.org/web/20250310092456/https://internetshutdowns.in/) are a byproduct of the government's control on telecommunications in our country. There are widespread concerns over [data privacy](https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/digital-rights-and-isp-accountability-in-india-an-analysis-of-policies-and-practices-pdf) and the regulations that ISPs must adhere to in order to prevent them from selling our data and building a [mass surveilance](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/12/india-requires-internet-services-collect-and-store-vast-amount-customer-data) state. Digital literacy gaps and the ability to provide stable internet access to rural areas continue to shape the evolving internet ecosystem in India.

## Is Starlink Possible in India?

The reason the other 34% of our population isn‚Äôt connected to the internet is due to three main factors: affordability, coverage, and digital literacy.

Major news outlets have tried to spin this by saying that the reason why our population isn't 100% digital is because of **poor coverage** but they fail to acknowledge the other 2 factors.

 Considering that they are going to be partnering with Jio and Airtel I would assume that they are going to pay the brunt of the cost. As of now, Indian wifi is the cheapest at just [6 rupees per gigabyte](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1024871/india-data-tariff-value-by-company/). Due to hypercompetition between providers, prices of data per Gb dropped drastically since 2020. On the other hand, both Airtel and Jio have invested a [significant amount of money](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/jio-airtel-vodafone-idea-spend-rs-9000-crore-on-deploying-infrastructure-during-pandemic/articleshow/82309492.cms) on optical fibre connections and equipment. This makes me wonder why they suddenly decided to drop their optical fibre plans and switch to Starlink services instead, especially when 6G connections are coming up. More investigation should be conducted.
 Airtel and Jio were both united to try and keep Starlink out of the competition when Starlink first tried to enter the market in 2021 but suddenly this week, they announced a partnership with Starlink:

In an unexpected turn of events, we got the big 2 of the telecom industry to partner with starlink. This unprecedented news makes me wonder how long this deal will last, and if it will prove profitable to all the 3 parties. 

As mentioned above, affordability is a key factor. If we want to provide access to underserved areas, we must make sure that it is affordable, durable and easy to install. This means that it must be cheaper so that it can be installed in villages and remote areas. 

They will have to maintain low data prices and ensure affordability for villagers. This gave rise to much speculation as to how they would cover the costs while maintaining world-class service. They would have to mass-manufacture satellites to cover the Indian subcontinent because each satellite only covers a limited space. While the cost of sending the satellites to space has decreased, it is still costly and we are yet to know how they plan to reduce the cost of the dish, installation and maintenance.

## Is Starlink Needed?

Since *Starlink* is a Low Earth Orbit satellite, it suffers from a slight latency which is fine for average consumers but would make it hard to use for gaming and high quality video streaming. 

| **Latency**                    | **Value**   |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Rated latency (as per website)                | 20-40 ms    |
| Tested latency low traffic     | 20 ms       |
| Tested latency high traffic    | 100 ms      |
| Tested latency avg             | 48 ms       |

[Starlink latency/ping values](https://blinqblinq.com/starlink-latency-and-ping-times/)

Optic Fibre will always be superior to LEO satellite technology because it is cheaper and faster and offers very low latency. Since Jio and Airtel have already built a vast fibre-optic system in India, this makes it the cheaper option for consumers living in metro cities. Conventional copper cable systems also exist for other cities and towns and is far cheaper than optic-fibre and Starlink. 

If they succeed in keeping their costs down then Starlink will benefit around 64 million Indians living in rural, remote areas as well as people living across the border. This would be of huge benefit to India and might help us reach a large population whose voices have not been heard. 

If Starlink is deployed across the border or for defense purposes, we must acknowledge that its systems have been vulnerable to jamming by adversaries. [Russia has been attacking Ukraine's starlink connection](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/starlink-in-danger-how-russias-kalinka-has-become-a-headache-for-elon-musk-and-a-nightmare-for-ukraine/articleshow/116389205.cms?from=mdr) continuously which implies that it cannot be a reliable source of communication in the borders.

## Security Concerns // Atmanirbhar Bharat

Starlink poses significant risk to the Indian security model because it relies solely on the satellites which are deployed and controlled by Elon Musk. Granted, they need to adhere to Indian laws and policies, but if we rely solely on Starlink for our communication like Ukraine, then we are bound to [pay the price](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87vg38dnpo). 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starlinks for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year.<br>The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers. <a href="https://t.co/WaJWCklgPE">https://t.co/WaJWCklgPE</a></p>&mdash; Rados≈Çaw Sikorski üáµüá±üá™üá∫ (@sikorskiradek) <a href="https://twitter.com/sikorskiradek/status/1898700362460070080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

The internet is our fundamental right, and in our pursuit to provide it to all of our people, we could be taking it away from them by outsourcing it to Elon Musk.

[Starlink has also been used in the past to bypass internet restrictions near our borders.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/03/elon-musks-starlink-satellites-allegedly-used-to-defy-indias-internet-shutdowns) Note: I do not support with internet shutdowns, I am using this example to showcase Starlink's security flaws  

Security concerns aside, while reading the data release by TRAI I observed that BSNL has been rapidly shrinking and is losing customers rapidly. BSNL is state-owned and is being crushed by the competition who are investing heavily into the future and are improving their services while providing flashy prices to consumers.

If India truly wants to improve coverage and make the internet accessible to all then I suggest that it must be **Made in India**. We could deploy our own LEO satellites by partnering with ISRO and could generate a self-sustaining connection with cheaper costs and full control. Of course, this would pose another set of security concerns and we would then question if the government should be in full control of the internet, considering that they have been actively censoring and imposing restrictions on the internet in the recent past.
